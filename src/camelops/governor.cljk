  "Camelid Facility Operations Governor -- the independent compliance
  layer that earns the CamelOpsAdvisor the right to commit. The LLM has
  no notion of:
    - Whether the facility a proposal targets is actually registered
    - Whether a proposal is a real actuation (`:effect :propose` only --
      this actor NEVER directly handles animals, administers treatment,
      or executes anything)
    - Whether an op is inside this actor's closed coordination allowlist
    - Whether a logged herd count is a plausible positive observation
    - Whether a logged fiber yield is a plausible non-negative observation
    - Whether a supply-order's cost exceeds the escalation threshold

  This MUST be a separate system able to *reject* a proposal and fall
  back to HOLD.

  This actor is a back-office OPERATIONS COORDINATOR only -- direct
  animal handling and veterinary treatment/slaughter decisions are
  categorically outside its authority (rancher/herder/veterinarian
  exclusive). The Governor enforces that boundary structurally, not by
  trusting the advisor's judgment.

  CRITICAL: Any proposal to flag an animal health/welfare concern ALWAYS
  escalates to a human (rancher/herder/veterinarian) for final sign-off.
  The LLM's confidence is never sufficient for animal-welfare decisions.

  Hard violations (always HOLD, no override, permanent):
    1. Facility not registered (facility-id missing or unknown to Store)
    2. Proposal `:effect` is not `:propose` (no direct execution, ever)
    3. Op is `:administer-treatment` or `:order-slaughter` -- direct
       treatment administration and slaughter/culling decisions are
       PERMANENTLY blocked regardless of proposal content or confidence
    4. Op is outside the closed proposal-op allowlist
    5. `:log-herd-record` with a non-positive herd count
    6. `:log-herd-record` with a negative fiber yield

  Soft gates (always escalate for human):
    - `:flag-animal-health-concern` -- ALWAYS escalates
    - `:order-supplies` above its category cost threshold
    - Low confidence

  This design mirrors `cattleops.governor` (cloud-itonami-isic-0141) but
  specializes camelid back-office coordination concerns (facility
  registration, closed op allowlist, treatment/slaughter exclusion, cost
  threshold, fiber-yield plausibility) rather than food-safety/cold-chain
  concerns."
